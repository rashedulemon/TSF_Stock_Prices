For efficient search key stored in node with multiple chiled a binary search is performed and search through the node until desired key found or reach a leaf node. for data insert first a binary search is initiated then find the key of the inset point if there is a room then key will insert there if there is no room or need to balenced the parent node being split and key is inserted.
